# equitysim

Harnesses the AlphaVantage API to pull, store, plot, and analyze equity data on the big players: any member of the S&P 500, Dow 30, or NASDAQ 100 indices, as well as any of the 100 most-traded ETFs and the top 25 most-traded mutual funds. 

See [the AlphaVantage documentation](https://www.alphavantage.co/documentation/) for more details on how API calls work within this code! 

## documentation of each file and its functions

### AlphaVantage data download/update suite

  - `load_single` downloads and processes a single symbol from AlphaVantage API into a file
  - `load_single_drive` downloads and processes a single symbol from local drive into a variable
  - `load_separate` downloads and processes many symbols from AlphaVantage API into many files
  - `load_combined_drive` downloads and processes many symbols from local drive into one variable
  - command prompt options:
    - `-tickerUniverse`: collection of tickers to download (can also be a CSV of ticker symbols) 
    - `-folderPath`: location of folder to store file
    - `-apiKey`: AlphaVantage API key (user-specific)
    - `-function`: distinguishes between intraday, daily, weekly, etc. downloads
    - `-interval` specifies what kind of intraday (1min, 15min, etc.)
- **single_download.py**
  - WARNING: code will be deleted soon
