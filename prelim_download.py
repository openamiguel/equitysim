## This code can download the constituents of the S&P 500, the Dow 30, and/or the NASDAQ 100.
## Alternatively, it can download each index as one combined file of closing prices.

			This will download separate files of daily data on S&P 500 tickers to the desired folder path.

		python prelim_download.py -tickerUniverse NASDAQ100 -folderPath C:/Users/Miguel/Desktop/stockData -separate -apiKey <INSERT KEY> -timeSeriesFunction INTRADAY -interval 1min
